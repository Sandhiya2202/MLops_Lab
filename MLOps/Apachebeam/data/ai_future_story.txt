Once upon a time, a curious student built a small machine that could learn.
The machine read thousands of pages, numbers, and songs, trying to make sense of the world.
Every day it grew a little smarter and a little kinder.
It learned to help people cook, drive, and dream.
But one day the student asked, “Will you ever replace me?”
The machine smiled in silence and wrote on the screen:
  I was never meant to replace you.
  I was meant to remind you how powerful you are when you learn.

From that day, the student and the machine worked together,
creating art, solving problems, and teaching others to imagine a better world.
